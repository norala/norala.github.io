                                I think harmony is essential to create special things. I have studied art and art theory and I would like to combine 
                                this ideas with my new knowledge in webdesign and development. Maybe it seems these are very different areas but 
                                the opportunity to build something new, something that maybe can change things lies in both. This is why I have passion 
                                for web development and why I would like to improve myself every day.
